## Need for Helm

---
class: center, middle

Kubernetes Helm fills the need to quickly and reliably provision container applications through easy install, update, and removal.

---
class: center, middle

Let's simplify things, to understand it deeply...

---
class: center, middle

How does K8s work?

---
class: center, middle

Kubernetes is a declarative system

---
class: center, middle

YAMLs Everywhere!

---
class: center, middle

For a scalable distributed application, you can have tons of microservices.

---

With each having their own specs for various K8s resources, like:

- Pods

- Deployments (for scalability and resilience)

- ConfigMaps / Secrets (for configuration)

- Service (for a server application)

- Volumes (for Stateful applications)

- RBAC / ServiceAccounts (for in-cluster management)

---
class: center, middle

Phew...

---
class: center, middle

What if you need multiple independent deployments within the same cluster?

---
class: center, middle

What if the (stateful) applications have a more complex startup/shutdown process?

---
class: center, middle

Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

---

## Helm Architecture

---

### Helm Concepts

- The `chart` is a bundle of information necessary to create an instance of a Kubernetes application.

- The `config` contains configuration information that can be merged into a packaged chart to create a releasable object.

- A `release` is a running instance of a chart, combined with a specific config.

---

### Helm Components

- Helm Client

- Helm Library

---

Client is responsible for:

- Local chart development

- Managing repositories

- Managing releases

- Interfacing with the Helm library

- Sending charts to be installed

- Requesting upgrading or uninstalling of existing releases

---
class: center, middle

The Helm Library provides the logic for executing all Helm operations.

---
class: center, middle

interfaces with the Kubernetes API server

---

Library is responsible for:

- Combining a chart and configuration to build a release

- Installing charts into Kubernetes, and providing the subsequent release object

- Upgrading and uninstalling charts by interacting with Kubernetes

---
class: center, middle

The standalone Helm library encapsulates the Helm logic so that it can be leveraged by different clients.

---
class: center, middle

The Helm client and library is written in the Go programming language.

## Working with Helm CLI

---

Helm can:

- Install and uninstall charts into an existing Kubernetes cluster

- Manage the release cycle of charts that have been installed with Helm

---
class: center, middle

### Installing and managing a chart

---

*Commands*:

- `helm install`

- `helm uninstall`

- `helm upgrade`

---
class: center, middle

Searching for charts to install: `helm search`

---
class: center, middle

We need to add a chart repo...

---

Helm cli can *also*:

- Interact with chart repositories where charts are stored: `helm repo`

---
class: center, middle

---
class: center, middle

*Exercise*: Installing and upgrading charts using `helm` cli

---
class: center, middle

### Writing your first chart

---

Helm cli can *also* do the following:

- Create new charts from scratch

- Package charts into chart archive (tgz) files

---

*Commands*:

- `helm create`

- `helm package`

---

---

```bash
Chart.yaml          # A YAML file containing information about the chart
values.yaml         # The default configuration values for this chart
charts/             # A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends.
templates/          # A directory of templates that, when combined with values,
                    # will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files.
```

```bash
templates/NOTES.txt # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing short usage notes
LICENSE             # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing the license for the chart
README.md           # OPTIONAL: A human-readable README file
values.schema.json  # OPTIONAL: A JSON Schema for imposing a structure on the values.yaml file
crds/               # OPTIONAL: Custom Resource Definitions
```

---

- The `templates/` directory is for template files.

- When Helm evaluates a chart, it will send all of the files in the `templates/` directory through the template rendering engine.

- It then collects the results of those templates and sends them on to Kubernetes.

- Template names do not follow a rigid naming pattern.

  - Use the suffix `.yaml` for YAML files and `.tpl` for helpers.

---

- The `values.yaml` file is important to templates.

- This file contains the *default values* for a chart.

- These values may be overridden by users during `helm install` or `helm upgrade`.

---

- In Helm, one chart may depend on any number of other charts.

- These dependencies can be dynamically linked using the dependencies field in `Chart.yaml` or brought in to the `charts/` directory and managed manually.

---
class: center, middle

`Chart.yaml`

---

```yaml
apiVersion: The chart API version (required)
name: The name of the chart (required)
version: A SemVer 2 version (required)
kubeVersion: A SemVer range of compatible Kubernetes versions (optional)
description: A single-sentence description of this project (optional)
type: The type of the chart (optional)
keywords:
  - A list of keywords about this project (optional)
home: The URL of this projects home page (optional)
sources:
  - A list of URLs to source code for this project (optional)
dependencies: # A list of the chart requirements (optional)
  - name: The name of the chart (nginx)
    version: The version of the chart ("1.2.3")
    repository: (optional) The repository URL ("https://example.com/charts") or alias ("@repo-name")
    condition: (optional) A yaml path that resolves to a boolean, used for enabling/disabling charts (e.g. subchart1.enabled )
    tags: # (optional)
      - Tags can be used to group charts for enabling/disabling together
    import-values: # (optional)
      - ImportValues holds the mapping of source values to parent key to be imported. Each item can be a string or pair of child/parent sublist items.
    alias: (optional) Alias to be used for the chart. Useful when you have to add the same chart multiple times
maintainers: # (optional)
  - name: The maintainers name (required for each maintainer)
    email: The maintainers email (optional for each maintainer)
    url: A URL for the maintainer (optional for each maintainer)
icon: A URL to an SVG or PNG image to be used as an icon (optional).
appVersion: The version of the app that this contains (optional). Needn't be SemVer. Quotes recommended.
deprecated: Whether this chart is deprecated (optional, boolean)
annotations:
  example: A list of annotations keyed by name (optional).
```

---

- Every chart must have a `version` number.

- A version must follow the [SemVer 2](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) standard.

---

- The `apiVersion` field should be `v2` for Helm charts that require at least Helm 3.

- Charts supporting previous Helm versions have an `apiVersion` set to `v1` and are still installable by Helm 3.

---

- When managing charts in a Chart Repository, it is sometimes necessary to deprecate a chart.

- The optional `deprecated` field in Chart.yaml can be used to mark a chart as deprecated.

---

- The `type` field defines the type of chart.

- There are two types: `application` and `library`.

---

- Application is the default type and it is the standard chart which can be operated on fully.

- The library chart provides utilities or functions for the chart builder.

- A library chart differs from an application chart because it is not installable and usually doesn't contain any resource objects.

- An application chart can be used as a library chart. This is enabled by setting the type to library.

### Packaging and hosting our chart in a repository

---
class: center, middle

To package: `helm package`

---
class: center, middle

A chart repository is an HTTP server that houses an `index.yaml` file and optionally some packaged charts.

.content-credits[https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/]

---

#### Chart repository structure

```bash
charts/
  |
  |- index.yaml
  |
  |- alpine-0.1.2.tgz
  |
  |- alpine-0.1.2.tgz.prov
```

---

- The index file is a yaml file called `index.yaml`.

- It contains some metadata about the package, including the contents of a chart's Chart.yaml file.

- A valid chart repository must have an index file.

- The index file contains information about each chart in the chart repository.
