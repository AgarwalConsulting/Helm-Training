# Steps (Reading & evaluation exercise)

- Create a default helm chart: `helm create <somename>`

- Figure out the rendered `deployment.yaml` & `ingress.yaml`, without using `helm` commands like: `install`, `template`
  - Read through the spec templates, and note how **YOU** think it would be evaluated

- Identify & compile the list of template functions being used

## Other instructions

- Ignore `include`, mark it as `NA` for now
